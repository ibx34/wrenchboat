## Inviting the bot
Currently to invite the bot you must be in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/q7Uq8TbYvr) so that you know when things happen as the bot is still in developement and may be unstable. But for the most part it is usable, i.e. moderation, utility, management.
> **Note**: Some modules of WrenchBoat may be unstable (meaning best to not use them in prod). We recommend sticking to moderation and management, not going near automation. Though if you're feeling spicy go ahead! Just know we aren't responsible if it does something. **You have been warned** 

## Known Issues
