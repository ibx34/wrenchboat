# Contributing Guidelines 

To start you are expected to have basic knowledge of what you're dealing with. This **does not mean** that you can't ask for help if you're stuck!

## Do's and Dont's
Do's                                  |
--------------------------------------|
Make meaning full commit messages (and or descriptions) |
Make sure you are contributing code that works (and doesnt have **intentional** bugs) |
We ask you're part of our [discord server](https://discord.gg/q7Uq8TbYvr) on case we have questions to ask |

Dont's                                  |
----------------------------------------|
Make joking commit messages |
making issues with no meaning behind them |
not accepting help from the community (It's better to work as a team) |
